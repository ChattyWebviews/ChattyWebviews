# Contributing to Chatty WebViews

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ChattyWebviews/ChattyWebviews/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ChattyWebviews/ChattyWebviews/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's an example of a [bug report](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

In this project, we adhere to the coding style laid out by the [New York Times Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/nytimes/objective-c-style-guide). By following a consistent style, our code is cleaner, more readable and more maintainable. The key points include, but are not limited to:

1. **Whitespace and Indentation**: 4 spaces should be used as the unit of indentation. There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity.
2. **Braces**: Open braces `{` should appear on the same line as the declaration and closing brace `}` should appear on a new line.
3. **Naming**: Favor clarity over brevity. Every declared variable and method should have a name that clearly explains its purpose.
4. **Imports**: Import only the modules a source file requires.
5. **Classes and Structures**: Types and variables should be defined with `let` where possible.
6. **Use of Self**: Use `self` only when required or when it enhances readability.

Please refer to the [NYT Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/nytimes/objective-c-style-guide) for a full list of conventions. This will ensure your contributions align with the existing project code.
